## üìñ About The Project

DisunicX is a production-ready web browser, proudly developed in India, designed from the ground up with privacy as its core principle. It integrates seamlessly with the Tor network, routing your traffic through Tor's volunteer-run overlay network to conceal your location and browsing activity from surveillance and traffic analysis.

The entire user interface is crafted using PySide6 (Qt for Python), providing a sleek, modern, and responsive dark-themed experience. It's a testament to what can be achieved with Python in the desktop application space.

### Key Features

*   **üîí Tor Integration**: Automatically connects to and routes traffic through the Tor network. A status indicator in the status bar keeps you informed of the connection.
*   **‚ú® Modern UI**: A beautiful, dark-themed interface with custom-drawn frameless window controls and a redesigned, icon-driven context menu. The new tab page logo is embedded for robustness, and settings apply without disruptive popups.
*   **üåê Tabbed Browsing**: A familiar and intuitive tabbed browsing experience with movable and closable tabs.
*   **üöÄ Custom New Tab Page**: An elegant and functional new tab page featuring a search bar, quick links to your most visited sites, and a minimalist design.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Comprehensive Settings**: A dedicated settings page (`disunic://settings`) to manage:
    *   **General**: Configure startup behavior and default search engine (Disunic, DuckDuckGo, Google, etc.).
    *   **Privacy & Security**: Control cookie policies, tracking protection, and set security levels (Standard, Safer, Safest) that manage JavaScript, plugins, and other potentially risky features.
    *   **Advanced**: Toggle Tor network usage, manage hardware acceleration, and set a custom User-Agent.
*   **üì• Integrated Download Manager**: A built-in page (`disunic://downloads`) to manage all your downloads, with support for pausing, resuming, and canceling.
*   **üìú Rich History Page**: A full-featured, searchable history page (`disunic://history`) to easily find pages you've visited.
*   **üîÑ Automatic Updates**: The browser automatically checks for new releases on GitHub and prompts you to download the latest version.
*   **üîñ Bookmarks Bar with Folders**: A fully functional bookmarks bar is now available. You can add bookmarks and organize them into nested folders for better organization. It can be toggled from the main menu.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools**: Includes essential developer features like "View Page Source" and "Inspect Element" (opens in a new tab).
*   **‚ûï Extra Features**:
    *   Save pages directly to PDF.
    *   Create a QR code for the current page URL.
    *   Clear all browsing data with a single click.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.8+**
*   **Tor Executable**: The browser requires a `disunic.exe` (your packaged Tor executable) to be present in the root directory of the project.
*   Install the required Python packages.

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh

    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Create a `requirements.txt` file with the content below)
    ```txt
    PySide6
    packaging
    qrcode[pil]
    ```
    Then run:

## üì¶ Building from Source

You can create a standalone executable using PyInstaller. This command bundles the application, its dependencies, and the Tor executable into a single distributable file.

Make sure PyInstaller is installed:
```sh
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then, run the build command from the project's root directory:

```sh
pyinstaller --noconsole --windowed --name DisunicX --icon=favicon.ico --add-data "disunic.exe;." --add-data "favicon.ico;." --hidden-import PySide6.QtSvg --hidden-import PySide6.QtNetwork --hidden-import PySide6.QtWebChannel --hidden-import PySide6.QtWebEngineWidgets main.py
```

The final `DisunicX.exe` will be located in the `dist/DisunicX` folder.
