## üìñ About The Project

DisunicX is a production-ready web browser, proudly developed in India, designed from the ground up with privacy as its core principle. It integrates seamlessly with the Tor network, routing your traffic through Tor's volunteer-run overlay network to conceal your location and browsing activity from surveillance and traffic analysis.

The entire user interface is crafted using PySide6 (Qt for Python), providing a sleek, modern, and responsive dark-themed experience. It's a testament to what can be achieved with Python in the desktop application space.
